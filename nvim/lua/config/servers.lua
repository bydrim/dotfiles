--  - cmd (table): Override the default command used to start the server
--  - filetypes (table): Override the default list of associated filetypes for the server
--  - capabilities (table): Override fields in capabilities. Can be used to disable certain LSP features.
--  - settings (table): Override the default settings passed when initializing the server.
