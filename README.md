# dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repo.

## prerequisites

python3, git. dotfiles are managed with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), which doesn't require installation.

## installation

clone this repository with  ```--recursive``` flag (for submodules).
run 'install' on linux and 'install.ps1' on windows. install scripts doesn't delete already existing files on the path.
still, run them at your own risk. also, linking is not adjusted for windows yet.
